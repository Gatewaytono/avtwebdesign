    <p>Open Adobe Illustraitor</p>
    <p>Click "Create New..."</p>
    <p>Create an 11' x 8.5' document</p>
    <p> We'll be making a bunny, so on the screen make a cirle thats 3in x 3in and color it #FAC4C5</p>
    <p> Next create an oval of the same color for the ears. After making that hold Alt and click + drag the shape to duplicate it. The oval should be 1.2in x 2.6 in. Drag it to the other side of the head.</p>
    <p> Make 2 more ovals that are 1in x 1.9in of the same color and rotate one of them by it 330°. </p>
    <p> Do the same as the step before and hold Alt and click + drag to another side.</p>
    <p> For the other oval, rotate it to 42.88°, and put it on the other oval to make half lopped ears. </p>
    <p> Next, make 2 black circles sized at 0.4177in x 0.4177 in. put them on the head to make eyes</p>
    <p> for the nose, make sure the color is also black. Go to the star tool and click somewhere on the screen. Set the points to 3 and click and drag on the screen to make an upside down triangle. Size it to 5.4057in x 0.3393in. click the direct selectin tool to round the corners.</p>
    <p> For the mouth, use the pen tool and make sure its on stroke. Under the nose, make a little U shape that goes to one side, and then repeat that to the otherside.</p>
